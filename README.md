## Description of the project
SQL Employee Tracker is a command line application (CLI) that allows you to perform basic operations with a related database, in this case POSTGRES. Display, add and update records using a connection to the database, in this case called thecompany_db.

The use of SQL to generate the queries represented the greatest motivation, from the simple department query to the complicated employee query, since this table handles a recursive relationship, meaning that an employee can have a relationship with another employee, in this case, that of being his or her manager.

Using a database represents the possibility of generating a fully functional application. It is to be able to do all operations with real data and through a relational database.

With the management of the database we are placed in the deepest part of the back end, opening endless possibilities in the development of applications.
